Once upon a time a rabbit and a tortoise lived in a forest.
The rabbit always teased the tortoise that he was slow.
One day they decided to have a race.
When the race started the rabbit had left the tortoise far behind as he was very fast than the tortoise.
When the rabbit was about to reach the finish line, he thought of resting under a tree as the tortoise was far behind.
But the rabbit had fallen to sleep instead of resting.
After some time the tortoise reached where the rabbit was resting.
He went past the rabbit towards the finish line.
By the time the rabbit woke up from sleep, the tortoise had won the race.

MORAL :- Slow and steady wins the race.
